# PySpark MNIST Clustering

## Overview

This repository explores the application of PySpark and KMeans clustering in data mining, specifically focusing on the MNIST dataset. The goal is to employ the KMeans algorithm to cluster handwritten digits, providing insights into patterns within the dataset.

**PySpark** is the Python API for Apache Spark, an open-source distributed computing system. Spark provides a fast and general-purpose cluster-computing framework for big data processing. PySpark simplifies the use of Spark through Python, making it accessible for data analysis, machine learning, and data mining tasks.

## KMeans Clustering

**KMeans clustering** is a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for grouping similar data points into clusters. In the context of data mining, KMeans helps identify patterns and relationships within large datasets. It is particularly effective for tasks such as image segmentation and grouping similar handwritten digits in the MNIST dataset.

## Data Source: MNIST Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the **MNIST dataset**, a collection of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 to 9). It is widely used in the field of machine learning for training and testing algorithms. The dataset contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images, making it a valuable resource for pattern recognition and clustering tasks.
